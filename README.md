# Interview Scheduler

Interview scheduler is a very useful interview booking appointment app which is simple, 
user-friendly and has a great design.

The student/user can navigate to the day to see if there is any spot available for an interview.
Then, click on the + button to create a new interview appointment, choose the interviewer, and save.
As simple as that! Wow!
And not to worry if the student/user makes some mistake with spelling name/ want to choose other 
interviewer, just click the edit icon and save the changes.
Also, the student/user can also delete the appointment by clicking the delete button.
Before deletion, the app will ask for final confirmation if the student/user wants to delete it.
Nice!
