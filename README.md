# Interview Scheduler

Interview scheduler is a very useful interview booking simple appointment app, 
user-friendly and has a great design.

The student as the user in this app can navigate to the day to see if there is any spot available for an interview.
Then, click on the + button to create a new interview appointment, choose the interviewer, and save.
There will be a warning message when the student does not put anything in the name form.

Not to worry if the student makes some mistake with spelling name/wants to choose another interviewer, 
just click the edit icon on the right side and save the changes.
The student can also delete the appointment by clicking the delete button.
Before deletion, the app will ask for final confirmation if the student wants to delete it.
So cool!
